# Rock–Paper–Scissors Game 🎮

This is a simple **Rock–Paper–Scissors** game implemented in Python.  
The player plays against the computer, which makes a random choice each round.  

And in the two_players.py file you can find the code in which one player can enter manually inside the code and run,
then second user can give their own input in terminal. Its just that first user will have to hide it when entering choice.
